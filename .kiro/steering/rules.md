## Non-Interactive Command Execution

This is a pure Dart web project

Do not EVER run this command:
dart run build_runner serve web:8080

For example don't run `make serve` or 'dart run build_runner serve web:8082' etc directly.
Just basic check that there are no errors, Don't try to rebuild everything after small changes.

When writing design documents and requirement documents:
* This is part of the 3-day game jam, so be aware to make high-value code changes only
* Cut the wording and the requirements in half. Keep the wording super concise and to the point.
