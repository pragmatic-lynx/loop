# Looping Audio Files

Place continuous/looping .ogg or .wav audio files here:

## Required Files:
- mage_charge_loop.ogg (when charging spells - seamless loop)

## Future Expansions:
- ambient_dungeon_loop.ogg (background dungeon atmosphere)
- fire_loop.ogg (fire damage over time)
- ice_loop.ogg (freezing effects)
- poison_loop.ogg (poison damage over time)

## Audio Guidelines:
- MUST be seamless loops (no gaps/clicks when repeating)
- Keep volume moderate (these play continuously)
- Should not be distracting during gameplay
- Test loop quality carefully
- Consider the "Loop" game jam theme!
